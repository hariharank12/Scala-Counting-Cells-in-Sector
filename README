This is to calculate Largest Sector in a Grid.

More here http://technicalshowoff.blogspot.in/2011/04/counting-cells-in-sector.html to find the description of the problem.

To define inputs, change the line at number 14 in LargestArea.scala, the following(which can be input from say AWT or Swing)

def getFilledCells = Set((0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2, 1)) //Your input comes here

To run the sample,

scalac -d ./class LargestArea.scala

scala -classpath ./class:. area.LargestArea

//To run as Java
java -classpath /usr/share/scala/lib/scala-library.jar:./class:. area.LargestArea

Scala is cool language to work with Functional Programming concepts under the constrained JVM.
